// SpotifyApi removed: backend integration was part of the original Java/Spring
// application. The project has been migrated to a static frontend + Node.js
// static server; Spotify requests are now performed directly from the browser
// using the user's access token (implicit grant / PKCE flow as implemented
// in `spotify-auth.js`).
